NBA_with_label.csv is the updated data with all player data from 1981 and add MVP voting until 2018.

There does not seem to be a good data set for MVP voting since 2018 so that may need to be entered manually. 
Similarly, there does not seem to be good data for any other awards. We will need to figure out how to work with this later.

There are currently some nan values in the data these are ALL from percentages where 0/0. They will most likely be assigned 0 when training for simplicity.
However, I have not touched them yet as there may be a different way to handle them later on.
